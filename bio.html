	<h1> About Me </h1>

	<p> I am currently a junior at Tufts University majoring in biology and minoring in computer science.
		I am interested in the intersection between healthcare and technology, and I hope to use technology 
		to help improve health outcomes, especially in underserved communities. I am also interested in 
		neuroscience, and much of my research focuses on the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases.
		At Tufts, I am the co-president of Tufts NeuroNetwork, an organization focused on cultivating 
		a community interested in neuroscience on the undergraduate campus, as well as a member of Tufts Premedical
		Society, and the Ballroom Team. In my free time, I enjoy learning new languages, traveling, baking banana bread,
		and biking along The Charles!
